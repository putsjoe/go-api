# HTTP Server in Go 

First attempt at a HTTP server for handling simple database requests with URLs.

Using included file (http.go) as a basis for testing and understanding.

Created saves.go - Will make this get the title of the given URL from the title tags.

Upgraded to go-1.5 because the package "net".

Using this to help with the html parsing: https://jdanger.com/build-a-web-crawler-in-go.html
